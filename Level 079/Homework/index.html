        <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h1>
        <p class="paragraph3">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br>
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I‚Äôve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from

        <h2 class="h2-2">Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br> recommended!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph7">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from 
        professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
        student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff 
        did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
        project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In<br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
        experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
