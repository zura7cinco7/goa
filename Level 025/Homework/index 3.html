        <h1>Inside_Out_2</h1>
        <p>Inside Out 2 is a 2024 American animated coming-of-age film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The sequel to Inside Out (2015), it was directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Mark Nielsen, from a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, and a story conceived by Mann and LeFauve. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan reprise their roles from the first film, with Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman (replacing Kaitlyn Dias), Liza Lapira (replacing Mindy Kaling), Tony Hale (replacing Bill Hader), Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Paul Walter Hauser joining the cast. The film tells the story of Riley's emotions as they find themselves joined by new emotions that want to take over Riley's head.

            Work on Inside Out 2 commenced in 2020 after Mann revisited photos of one of his childhood birthday parties. The film features Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter's "five to 27 emotions" idea from the first film that Mann pitched during its production to utilize "truthful" worldbuilding.

            <i>plot</i>
            <p>Two years after her move to San Francisco,[c] 13-year-old Riley Andersen is entering high school. Her personified emotions—Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger—now oversee a newly formed element of Riley's mind called her "Sense of Self", which houses memories and feelings that shape Riley's beliefs. Joy, aiming to fill the Sense of Self with only positive memories, has created a mechanism that launches negative memories to the back of Riley's mind.

                Riley and her best friends, Bree and Grace, are invited to a weekend ice hockey camp, where Riley hopes to qualify for her new school's team, the Firehawks. In the mind, a "Puberty Alarm" goes off the night before camp, and a group of workers upgrade the emotion console, leaving Headquarters in disarray. The emotions find that Riley now overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions—Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui—arrive and clash with the original emotions over their approaches. In particular, Joy wants Riley to have fun at camp, while Anxiety focuses on winning a spot on the team and making new friends, especially after Riley learns that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school.
                
                Under Joy's control, Riley inadvertently gets the campers punished by the strict camp director, Coach Roberts. Anxiety, deciding that Riley needs to change to fit in with the older players, launches the Sense of Self to the back of Riley's mind and has Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust captured and thrown into a memory vault. Anxiety, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment then create a new anxiety-dominated Sense of Self and encourage Riley to befriend popular hockey player Valentina "Val" Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust escape the vault; while the others go to retrieve Riley's old Sense of Self, Sadness returns to Headquarters to prepare to bring them back via a recall tube. Sadness is discovered by Embarrassment, but due to his second thoughts on Anxiety’s plan, he helps her remain hidden, and eventually helps her out.
                
                Under Anxiety's control, Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts' office and learns from her notebook that Riley is not considered ready to become a Firehawk. The old emotions find the old Sense of Self on a mountain of negative memories deposited by Joy's mechanism. Unable to use the recall tube as planned due to Anxiety destroying it, they cause an avalanche of memories to return them to Headquarters, causing the negative memories to spill into Riley's Belief System. Anxiety realizes that the Sense of Self she has created for Riley is one of self-doubt, which causes Riley to perform poorly during her final tryout match, accidentally hurt Grace, and get sent to the penalty box. Horrified, Anxiety frantically swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing Riley to have an anxiety attack.
                
                Returning to Headquarters, Joy finds Anxiety still in control but in paralysis; Joy convinces her that Riley does not need to change to have a better future. Anxiety relents and Joy reinstates Riley's original Sense of Self, but the panic attack persists. After Anxiety admits that she cannot determine who Riley is, Joy realizes that the same applies to her. Joy removes the first Sense of Self and allows a new one to form from Riley's positive and negative memories. The emotions embrace this third Sense of Self, calming Riley and helping her reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console calls for Joy, who takes command and helps Riley happily finish the hockey tryouts.
                
                Riley befriends Val and the other Firehawks at high school, while maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Living in peace, the original and new emotions work together to protect Riley, who checks her phone for the Firehawks' recruitment results[d] and looks at herself in the mirror with a proud smile.</p>
