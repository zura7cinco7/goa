            <h2>Book</h2>
            <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images.</p>
            <p>Modern books are typically in codex format, composed of many pages that are bound together and protected by a cover; they were preceded by several earlier formats, including the scroll and the tablet. 
            The book publishing process is the series of steps involved in their creation and dissemination.</p>

                <p>Books are sold at both regular stores and specialized bookstores, as well as online for delivery, and can be borrowed from libraries. The reception of books has led to a number of social consequences, including censorship.

                    The modern book industry has seen several major changes due to new technologies, including ebooks and audiobooks (recordings of books being read aloud). Awareness of the needs of print-disabled people has led to a rise in formats designed for greater accessibility, such as braille printing and large-print editions. Google Books estimated in 2010 that approximately 130 million total unique books had been published.
                    
                    Etymology
                    The word book comes from the Old English bōc, which in turn likely comes from the Germanic root *bōk-, cognate to "beech".[1] In Slavic languages like Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian буква bukva—"letter" is cognate with "beech". In Russian, Serbian and Macedonian, the word букварь (bukvar') or буквар (bukvar) refers to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writings may have been 
                    carved on beech wood.[2] The Latin word codex, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".[3]</p>
