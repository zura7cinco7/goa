        <p>The iPhone, which operates using Apple's proprietary iOS software, is one of the two major smartphone platforms in the world, 
            alongside Android. The first-generation iPhone was described by Steve Jobs as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry. The 
            iPhone has been credited with popularizing the slate smartphone form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, 
            or "app economy", laying the foundation for the boom of the market for mobile devices. In addition to the apps that come pre-installed on iOS, there are nearly 2 
        million apps available for download from Apple's mobile distribution marketplace, the App Store, as of August 2024.</p>
